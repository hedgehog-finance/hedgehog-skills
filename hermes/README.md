# Hermes Skills

A collection of 20 skills adapted for Hermes Agent. The skill logic is synchronized from the OpenClaw distribution, with Hermes-native secret declarations and explicit Node.js runtime requirements.

## Runtime Setup

Hermes Agent is Python-based and does not guarantee a Node.js runtime. Every skill declares `prerequisites.commands: [node]` and requires Node.js >=18 through its `compatibility` metadata. Skills with npm dependencies also declare `npm`; install their local dependencies before first use:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/skills/<skill-name>
npm install
```

Skills requiring `npm install`: `company-valuation`, `doc-convert`, `fin-calc`, `gen-chart`, `gen-ppt`, `math_calc`, `table-convert`, `tech-indicators`, and `web_fetch`.

### Authentication

`hedgehog-company-index-data`, `hedgehog-macro-industry-data`, and `hedgehog-news-reports` declare `CIWEIAI_API_KEY` through Hermes' `required_environment_variables`. Hermes securely stores the secret in `~/.hermes/.env`, prompts for it on local skill load when missing, and passes it through to terminal sandboxes.

```bash
hermes config set CIWEIAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
```

Do not put API keys in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` or skill files.
