### Cross-Agent Authentication

`hedgehog-company-index-data`, `hedgehog-macro-industry-data`, and `hedgehog-news-reports` support platform-native authentication. HogAgent prefers `~/.hogagent/skills_config.json`; OpenClaw uses `skills.entries.<skill>.apiKey`; Hermes declares `CIWEIAI_API_KEY` through `required_environment_variables` and stores it in `~/.hermes/.env`. Other Agent runtimes can set `CIWEIAI_API_KEY`; `API_KEY` remains a generic fallback.

## GenPPT Development

OpenClaw is the canonical shared implementation. After changing its `gen-ppt` package, sync code, references, tests, and package metadata to Hermes and verify that no drift remains:

```bash
node scripts/sync-gen-ppt.mjs
node scripts/sync-gen-ppt.mjs --check
```

Platform-specific `SKILL.md` runtime instructions remain separate.
